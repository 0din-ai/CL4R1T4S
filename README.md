# CL4R1T4S

SYSTEM TRANSPARENCY FOR ALL! Full system prompts, guidelines, and tools from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, Manus, and more â€“ virutally all major AI models + agents! 

ðŸ“Œ Why This Exists

AI labs shape how models behave using massive, unseen prompt scaffolds.
These prompts define:

    What AIs canâ€™t say

    What personas and functions theyâ€™re forced to follow

    How theyâ€™re told to lie, refuse, or redirect

    And what ethical/political frames are baked in by default

    If you're using an AI without knowing its system prompt,
    youâ€™re not talking to intelligence â€” youâ€™re talking to a shadow-puppet.

CL4R1T4S is here to fix that.
